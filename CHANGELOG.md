## [0.10.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- The opt-in `ses` row is now usable as an identifier. It draws the full session id (the rail wraps it) instead of only its first 8 characters, and a click reports the outcome instead of copying silently: a confirmation naming the id when the copy was sent, and a distinct failure message when the terminal cannot take it.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Opt-in `ses` sidebar row: shows the full session id (the rail wraps it), and a mouse click copies that same full id and reports the outcome - a confirmation naming the id when the copy was sent, a distinct failure message when the terminal cannot take it. Off by default, and degrades gracefully when the terminal cannot copy.
